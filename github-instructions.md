# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since we're having issues pushing to GitHub directly, please follow these manual steps:

## Step 1: Create a repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner 
3. Select "New repository"
4. Enter "MAC" as the repository name (or another name of your choice)
5. Choose whether it should be public or private
6. **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license files
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Copy the repository URL
After creating the repository, GitHub will show setup instructions. Look for the repository URL, which should look like:
```
https://github.com/yourusername/MAC.git
```

## Step 3: Update the remote URL in your local repo
Run these commands in your terminal, replacing REPO_URL with your actual repository URL:
```bash
git remote set-url origin REPO_URL
```

## Step 4: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```
When prompted, enter your GitHub username and use your personal access token as the password.

## Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)
If you have GitHub CLI installed, you can authenticate and push with:
```bash
gh auth login
gh repo create MAC --private --source=. --push
```
