# Test Report for MAC Application

## Overview
This report summarizes the current state of the test suite for the MAC (Modbus Application Client) system. We've implemented a comprehensive test strategy covering both client and server components.

## Client Tests

### Component Tests
- **UI Component Tests**: Basic UI components like Button have been tested to ensure they render correctly with different props and handle events properly.
- **Device Component Tests**: Components like DeviceCard have been created but need path fixes in imports.
- **Dashboard Component Tests**: StatusSummary and other dashboard components have tests created but need import path fixes.

### Utility Tests
- **Formatter Tests**: All basic formatter utilities are now tested and passing, including date, number, and text formatting functions.

### Hook Tests
- **useDevices Hook**: Tests are created but need path fixes.

### Context Tests
- **AuthContext**: Tests are created but need path fixes.

## Server Tests

### API Tests
- **Device Routes**: Tests are created but there are some assertion issues to fix.
- **Auth Routes**: Basic tests created but need updates to mock dependencies.
- **Profile Routes**: Tests created but need fixes for dependencies.

### Controller Tests
- **Auth Controller**: Tests are passing successfully.
- **Device Controller**: Tests created but need mock updates.

### Middleware Tests
- **Auth Middleware**: Tests are partial passing, but some assertion errors need to be fixed.

### Model Tests
- **Device Model**: Tests are passing successfully.
- **User Model**: Tests created but require mock fixes.

### E2E Tests
- **Auth Workflow**: End-to-end tests created but need updated mocks for MongoDB operations.
- **Device Workflow**: End-to-end tests created but need fixes for dependency mocks.

## Required Fixes

1. **Client Tests**:
   - Fix import paths in component tests
   - Update assertions to match actual component implementation
   - Fix context provider wrapping in component tests that use contexts

2. **Server Tests**: 
   - Update User model mocks to properly handle methods like `.findById().select()`
   - Fix MongoDB mock to handle operations like `deleteMany`
   - Update JWT verification mocks
   - Fix API test assertions to handle both possible response codes

## Running Tests

- **Client Tests**: `cd client && npm test`
- **Server Tests**: `cd server && npm test`
- **All Tests**: `npm test` from the project root

## Next Steps

1. Fix all failing tests
2. Add more test coverage for untested components
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline to run tests on commits
4. Add performance and load testing for the server APIs
